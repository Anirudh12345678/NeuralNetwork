A Neural Network Built in C++, with NO external libraries.
The output layer cannot exceed 9 Neurons.
Pass the topology and the training Data in the same format in the trainingData.txt file.
The mock training data right now is used to make a neural network into an X-OR Gate.
The training data can be modified according to the use cases.
 Enjoy!
